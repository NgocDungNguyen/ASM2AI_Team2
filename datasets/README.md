# Weather Data Prediction with Machine Learning Models


## Project Overview
This project is focused on building and fine-tuning machine learning models to predict weather patterns, particularly the maximum temperature for New York City. The dataset used in this project was sourced from Visual Crossing Weather. The project involves various regression models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LGBM, and more.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is based on historical weather data for New York City, which includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other features.
