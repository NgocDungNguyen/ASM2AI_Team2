    "#### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of several Machine Learning models in a pipeline to generate forecasts for the future maximum temperature in New York City based on historical weather data. The dataset comprises the following characteristics: temperature, humidity, windspeed, cloud cover, and other variables associated to weather. Our approach involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and application of diverse machine learning models. "
